# Stocksplosion

(Unfortunatly Windows was the only OS available to me, so I was unable to test on Linux or Mac.)

1. If you haven't already, install Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org/downloads/), pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) and virtualenv (http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)
2. Either check-out this repo if you have and know how to use Git, or use the "Download as ZIP" option on the side.
3. Activate the virtual environment by entering "source venv/Scripts/activate.bat" into the command line from the directory you created in step 2
4. Enter "python manage.py server" into the command line to start the server. By default you can reach it at localhost:5000
5. That's it! Enjoy up to date stock information.
